                Learning a language is one of the most rewarding, but also most challenging things we've ever done. Traditional tools like textbooks have been essential for us. But what we've found is that we learn best through rich, engaging experiences. It's easy to remember words when they're reinforced by experiences that move you. We also believe early exposure to engaging content helps prevent learners from giving up before they're fluent. A site that can deliver such rich experiences, supported by the right set of tools, can transform language learning. We're working to make that site a reality for you. LEW is brought to you by a team of passionate language learners.
